## Introduction

This guide will show you how to **bundle your Scratch project** into a **standalone app** using **Scratch Everywhere (SE)**.  
Once built, your project will behave like a native app on supported platforms such as **3DS, Wii U, GameCube, PS4, Vita**, and more!

To make things easier and avoid installing tons of dependencies manually, we‚Äôll use **Docker**  
think of it as a small, isolated Linux system that automatically sets everything up for you.

---

## What You‚Äôll Need

- A working **Docker installation**  
- The **Scratch Everywhere** source code (from GitHub)  
- Your **Scratch project (.sb3)**  
- A bit of patience, compiling can take several minutes

---

## Step 1: Install Docker

1. Go to [https://docker.com](https://docker.com)
2. Click **‚ÄúDownload Docker Desktop‚Äù**
   ![image](pictures/docker.png)
3. Choose your operating system.

4. On Windows, make sure you select the correct installer for your CPU:
   - **ARM / x64** ‚Üí use the ARM installer  
   - **AMD64 / x86** ‚Üí use the AMD64 installer  
5. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  
6. Once installed, **launch Docker Desktop** to make sure it‚Äôs running.

## Step 2: Download Scratch Everywhere

1. Visit the official Scratch Everywhere repository:  
	[https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere)
2. Click the green **‚Äú<> Code‚Äù** button.  
   ![image](pictures/Github.png)
3. Choose **‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù**  
   ![image](pictures/download.png)
4. Extract this ZIP to a convenient location, for example, near your Scratch project.

---

## Step 3: Prepare Your Scratch Project

1. Rename your Scratch project‚Äôs file extension from `.sb3` ‚Üí `.zip`  
   Example:  Scratch Project.sb3 ‚Üí Scratch Project.zip
2. Right-click both ZIP files (the Scratch Everywhere one and your project) and select **‚ÄúExtract All...‚Äù**  
![image](pictures/extract.png)
3. You should now have extracted folders that look something like this:  
![image](pictures/delete.png)
4. You can delete the original `.zip` files, we don‚Äôt need them anymore.

---

## Step 4: Set Up the Project Folder Structure

1. Open the folder: ScratchEverywhere-main/ScratchEverywhere/
2. Inside, create a **new folder** named `romfs`  
![image](pictures/romfs.png)
3. Copy your extracted Scratch project folder into `romfs`
![image](pictures/move.png)
4. Rename your project folder to **`project`** (all lowercase!)  
![image](pictures/rename.png)

Your structure should now look like this:

ScratchEverywhere-main/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ScratchEverywhere/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ romfs/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gfx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ make/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

---

## Step 5: Customize Icons and Graphics

Inside the `gfx` folder, you‚Äôll find all the **platform-specific icons and graphics**.  
For example, the `icon.png` file is used as the app icon on consoles like the 3DS.

- You can **replace** these images with your own graphics.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not change the file sizes, names, or extensions.**  
  The images must keep their **exact dimensions** and **same filenames** (e.g. `icon.png`).

To modify banners or special icons, open the subfolder with the name of your target console (e.g., `3ds/`, `wiiu/`, etc.).

---

## Step 6: Change App Information (Title, Description, Author)

1. Go into the `make` folder.
   ![image](pictures/makefiles.png)
2. Find the `Makefile` that matches your target platform.  
   For example:  
	Makefile_3ds
	Makefile_wiiu
3. Open it in a text editor.  
4. Near the top, you‚Äôll find a section where you can change:
- **App Title**
- **Description**
- **Author Name**

![image](pictures/changeName.png)

> Tip: It‚Äôs nice (but not required) to mention somewhere in your description that your app was built using **Scratch Everywhere**.

Save the file after making your changes.

---

## Step 7: Build the App Using Docker

1. Make sure **Docker Desktop is running**.  
2. Go back to your main `ScratchEverywhere` folder (the one that contains `romfs`, `gfx`, `make`, etc.).
3. Click in the **address bar** at the top of the window
![image](pictures/addressbar.png)
	and type: cmd 
![image](pictures/typecmd.png)
	Then press **Enter**.  
4. A Command Prompt window should open in the correct directory.  
Verify that the path shown matches your `ScratchEverywhere` folder.
![image](pictures/cmd.png)
If not, you can manually navigate to it:
cd C:\Path\To\ScratchEverywhere-main\ScratchEverywhere

### Build Commands

Use one of the following commands depending on your target platform:

| Platform | Command |
|-----------|----------|
| **3DS** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.3ds --target exporter -o . .` |
| **Wii U** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wiiu --target exporter -o . .` |
| **Wii** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wii --target exporter -o . .` |
| **GameCube** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.gamecube --target exporter -o . .` |
| **Nintendo Switch** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.switch --target exporter -o . .` |
| **PS Vita** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.vita --target exporter -o . .` |
| **PS4** | `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.ps4 --target exporter -o . .` |

The build process may take several minutes, depending on your system.

When finished, it should look something like this:

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `ERROR: failed to build: resolve : CreateFile docker: The system cannot find the file specified.` | You‚Äôre not in the correct `ScratchEverywhere` folder, or the `docker/` folder is missing or empty. | Check your folder structure or re-download Scratch Everywhere. |
| `ERROR: Error response from daemon: Docker Desktop is manually paused.` | Docker is paused. | Click the üêã Docker icon in your system tray ‚Üí select **Resume** or **Restart**. |
| `ERROR: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": ... The system cannot find the file specified.` | Docker isn‚Äôt running. | Open Docker Desktop and wait until it‚Äôs fully started. |

---

## Step 8: Find Your Compiled Game

After a successful build, your exported files will appear directly in the `ScratchEverywhere` folder.

| Platform | Output Location | File Types |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **3DS** | Main folder | `.3dsx` and `.cia` |
| **Wii U** | `scratch-wiiu` folder | `.rpx` and `.wuhb` |
| **Other platforms** | Typically in their respective subfolders | Various |

You can now copy these files to your console and install or launch them like any other homebrew app!

## Final Notes

Congratulations, you‚Äôve successfully built your own **standalone Scratch app** using Scratch Everywhere!

If something doesn‚Äôt work:
- Double-check folder names and paths (especially lowercase `project`)
- Make sure Docker is running and not paused
